Hello,
 
Moderna's virtual BI&D event, Breaking Barriers at Moderna, taking place on Wednesday, April 26th from 5pm – 6pm ET. As a company that values belonging, inclusion and diversity, Moderna is eager to connect with Northeastern students and provide them with an opportunity to learn about our innovative technology and commitment to inclusivity.

In addition to learning about Moderna's technology, attendees will have the chance to speak with members of our Campus team about co-op and internship opportunities, as well as explore our Employee Resource Groups.

Please find the website here with additional event information and registration details. The event flyer with a QR code to register is also attached for you to share with students. Invitations with a link to join will be sent shortly after registering.

 
 
Best,
Cassandra
