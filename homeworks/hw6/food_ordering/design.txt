Design - Food Delivery System

The system for food delivery would need Restaurants and Customers. Customers and Restaurants interact 
through Orders and Deliveries, which both involve data such as FoodItems and the addresses of the 
respective customer/restaurant. FoodItem is another class that has data regarding name and price and can be
created by Restaurant and put on the Menu. Menu is a class that handles all FoodItems of a restaurant. 
Instances of FoodItem is also held in UserAccount, which represents the account of a Customer and stores that customer's 
favorite food and payment information. In addition, there is a Cart which the User can add FoodItems to. When the User 
places an Order, that cart is transformed into an Order. An Order contains the Cart, the customer placing the order, 
and the Restaurant. The Restaurant can then confirm the order. If they confirm, then the Restaurant makes a Delivery, 
which has a status in addition to the origin and destination addresses. From there, the User can track the status of 
their food delivery.
